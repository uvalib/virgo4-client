         <h2>Thank you for your course reserves request!</h2>
         <p>A copy of your request has been emailed to you.</p>
         <p>If we have questions regarding your request someone will contact you.</p>
         <p>When your request has been processed, you'll be able to see your non-video
            reserves by signing into your Virgo account and clicking the Course Reserves menu option.</p>
         <p>
            If the Library doesnâ€™t own an item that you need for reserve, you may make a
            <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/purchase-requests/" target="_blank">purchase recommendation</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            If you have personal copies of items to be placed on reserve, please complete our
            <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/course-reserves/personal/" target="_blank">Personal Copy Form</a>
